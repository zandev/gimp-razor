# Tiny wrapper around ant for the ease of preconfiguration
# IMPORTANT:
# All configurations entries defined in your recipes are internally loaded with a prefix of 'cfg.'
# If you need to override some of these configurations right at the command line, you must prefix them.
# ie: To override 'processors', use -Dcfg.processors=${value}
