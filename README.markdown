# gimp-razor is

a script to automate the process of compiling the gimpâ€™s latest development version and its dependencies.
It's primarily intended to be used on Ubuntu, but with a little work, it should work on any linux distro.

# Usage

    sudo apt-get install git-core
    git clone git://github.com/zanshine/gimp-razor.git
    cd gimp-razor
    ./gimp-razor

For more customization, see the top of the script.
